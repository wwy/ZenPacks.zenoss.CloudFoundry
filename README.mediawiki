Please watch the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDUUVTWXCPE Monitoring Cloud
Foundry] video for a quick introduction that covers most of the details below.

This ZenPack makes it possible to monitor the capacity and performance of
applications running on a Cloud Foundry platform. This works for applications
hosted in a local micro-cloud or a hosted environment such as the one offered
by VMware at cloudfoundry.com.

[http://www.cloudfoundry.com/ Cloud Foundry] is an open PAAS (Platform as a Service) project initiated by [http://www.vmware.com/ VMware].

== Usage ==

Once the CloudFoundry ZenPack is installed you can add endpoints by going to
the infrastructure screen and clicking the normal button for adding devices.
You will find a new option labeled, "Add CloudFoundry Endpoint."

Choose that option and you'll be presented with a dialog asking for the following inputs.

# Target - An example would be api.cloudfoundry.com or api.vcap.me.
# Email - The email address you used to register.
# Password

Once you click Add Zenoss will contact the target and get all of the
operationally interesting information that exists. Once it is complete you'll
find a new device in the /CloudFoundy device class with the same name as the
target you entered into the dialog. Click into this new device to see
everything that was discovered.

The following elements are discovered:

* Frameworks
** Runtimes
** App Servers
* System Services
* Provisioned Services
* Apps
** App Instances

The following performance metrics are collected:

* Per-Endpoint (target)
** Limits
